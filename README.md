In 2013, my interest in programming began during an ICT course, but at that time I didn't pursue the idea of ​​the future. However, in 2022, after completing my degree in Accounting and realizing that this was not my true calling, I decided to follow my passion for programming. In October 2022, I took the first step on my journey by enrolling in the Systems Analysis and Development course at Estácio. Since then, I have dedicated myself with determination to fulfill my dream of working in software development.
